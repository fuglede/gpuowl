Build

GpuOwl can be built using Make or Meson.


1. Build using Make

Simply run "make" in the base folder (the one containing the file "Makefile").
All the files produced by the build, including the executable "gpuowl", are written to the folder "build".


2. Build using Meson

Starting in the base folder (the one containing the file "meson.build" and "Makefile"), create an empty build folder;
cd to the build folder, and invoke meson pointing it to the base folder. Next run *ninja* to actually build.
Example:

mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
meson ..
ninja
